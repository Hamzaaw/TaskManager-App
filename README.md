# Task Manager App

Welcome to the repository for our Task Manager App. This application is designed to streamline task management processes, providing a robust and user-friendly interface for managing daily tasks.

## Built With

- Spring Framework: The backend of this app is built using the Spring Framework, an application framework and inversion of control container for the Java platform. This framework provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications.
